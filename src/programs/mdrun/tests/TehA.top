;	This '.top' file was simplified manually from a pdb2gmx generated file 
;	By user: tullman (506382)
;	On host: tullman
;	At date: Thu Mar 10 2016
;
;	This is a standalone topology file
;
;	The initial topology was generated using program:
;	pdb2gmx_d - VERSION 4.6.5
;
;	Command line was:
;	pdb2gmx_d -f input_sRTUct.gro -o output_sRTUct.gro -q processed_input_sRTUct.gro -i posre.itp -p topol.top -n index.ndx -ff charmm36 -water tip4p -norenum -vsite aromatics

; Include forcefield parameters
#include "charmm27.ff/forcefield.itp"

; should normally be added to ffbonded.itp in the force field directory, but adding it here
; lets the terst case run with the charmm27.ff as distributed with GROMACS, RTU Apr 2016
[ constrainttypes ]
; this section is copied from OPLS. In theory we could recalculate
; optimal geometries from charmm values, but since practical equilibrium
; geometries do not correspond exactly to these values anyway it is not
; worth the effort...
